		<p> During the supply shortage and recall period, manufacturers have increased the price of low-cost prescription medicines. This increase has led to the increasing cost of people who need it. Nearly 120 drugs are currently or recently in shortage, and about one-third had price increases after the shortages began. The price growth of some medicine has become unusual, the biggest price increase rate even reaches 1137%. In addition, the time of drug shortage and the increase in price are also related. The average prices roses about 14% for drugs in shortages lasting at least 18 months, and 6% during shortage of less than six months. Although the price for these low-cost drugs is increasing, people would choose them due to the higher price of the brand-name drugs. The author believes that those manufacturers should boost production to meet customerâ€™s demand and take responsibility to the costs of increase production. </p>
